## Spotify Connected App
This is the End Product of 'Build a spotify connected app' newline course

This repl has the frontend code of the web app, for the backend see: https://github.com/androso/spotify_app-bk

Because Spotify doesn't extend quota for 'hobby' projects anymore, only people who i add on my dev console can see their stats (let me know if you want).

The intention for this project was to dive into the backend with nodejs, which i'm currently learning :)

## Installation and Set Up
1. Register a Spotify app in your [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) and add `https://yourReplName.yourUsername.repl.co/callback` (for this first set up the repl) as a Redirect URI in the app settings.
2. Add your unique `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` from the spotify dashboard to Secrets.
3. Install dependencies
4. Don't worry about deployment because we are in Replit ðŸ’–

## Running React on Repl.it

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

### Getting Started
- Hit run
- Edit [App.jsx](#src/App.jsx) and watch it live update!

By default, Replit runs the `dev` script, but you can configure it by changing the `run` field in the `.replit` file.
